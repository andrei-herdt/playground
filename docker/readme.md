For NVIDIA support you need to install `nvidia-docker`: [installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker). 

> Note if running ./run_docker.sh gives you error:
> ```
> docker: Error response from daemon: could not select device driver "" with capabilities: gpu.
> ```
> This means you haven't properly configured the docker support for your graphics card.
